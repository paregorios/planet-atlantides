                <p>Most frequently given answer: Please do not ask me to "post" notices about your
                    individual posts to these aggregators. Content here is automatically scooped up
                    from the blogs and sites listed on the individual subscription lists if their
                    feeds are formatted in a standard way and are readily accessible on the web. If
                    you think that your blog or website should be included in a particular
                    aggregator, but it does not appear in the associated subscription list, please
                    contact me with a request for its addition. Note that I reserve the right to say
                    a respectful "no."</p>

                                <li>Updated 11 Feb 2008: I hope eventually to combine this feed into
                                    the Maia aggregator, but right now it's exhibiting encoding
                                    problems (characters above base ASCII are getting borked). This
                                    is strange, given it displays fine in Firefox (but not in the
                                    venus output, nor in my RSSOwl client). I'll have to set aside
                                    some time to try to figure out what's going awry.</li>

                    <h2 class="planetoid">Feed reading, bots, and user agents</h2>
                    <p>As implied above, <i>Planet Atlantides</i> uses Sam Ruby's "Venus" branch of the <i>Planet</i> "river of news" feed reader. That code is written in the Python language and uses an earlier version of the <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/index.html">Universal Feed Reader</a> library for fetching web feeds (RSS and Atom formats). Out of the box, its http requests use the feed parser's default <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent">user agent</a> string, so your server logs will only have recorded "UniversalFeedParser/4.2-pre-274-svn +http://feedparser.org/" when our copy of the software pulled your feed in the past.</p>
                    <p><strong>Effective 27 February 2014, the <i>Planet Atlantides</i> production version of the code now identifies itself with the following user agent string: "PlanetAtlantidesFeedBot/0.2 +http://planet.atlantides.org/".</strong> Production code runs on a machine with the IP address 66.35.62.81, and never runs more than once per hour. Apart for a one-time set of test episodes on 27 February 2014 itself, log entries recording our user agent string and a different IP address represent spoofing by a potential bad actor other than me and my automagical bot. You should nuke them from orbit; it's the only way to be sure. Note that from time-to-time, I may run test code from other IP addresses, but I will in future use the user agent string beginning with "PlanetAtlantidesTestBot" for such runs. You can expect them to be infrequent and irregular.</p>
                    <p>Please email me if you have any questions about Planet Atlantides, its bot, or these user agent strings. In particular, if you put something like "PlanetAtlantidesBot is messing up my site" in your subject line, I'll look at it and respond as quickly as I can.</p>
